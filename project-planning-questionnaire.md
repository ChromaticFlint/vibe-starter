## How to Use This Questionnaire

1. **Answer the questions** that are relevant to your project
2. **Skip questions** that don't apply to your specific use case
3. **Be specific** - detailed answers lead to better project specifications
4. **Think about edge cases** - consider unusual but possible scenarios
5. **Consider the future** - think about how the project might evolve

## Next Steps

After completing this questionnaire:

1. Use your answers to fill out the `project-requirements-template.md`
2. Create a customized requirements document for your specific project
3. Share the requirements with AI assistants for more targeted development help
4. Use the requirements as a reference throughout development
5. Update the requirements as your project evolves
