# Testing Best Practices for Vibe Projects

## Overview

This document outlines essential testing practices that should be implemented in every vibe-coded project. These tests ensure application reliability, security, accessibility, and performance.

## 🚨 Mandatory Tests (Before Every Commit)

### 1. Application Health Tests
**Purpose**: Ensure the application renders without errors and functions correctly.

```typescript
// src/__tests__/AppHealth.test.tsx
- ✅ Renders without console errors
- ✅ Renders without console warnings  
- ✅ App renders successfully
- ✅ Contains expected content
- ✅ No JavaScript errors during render
```

### 2. API Health & Connection Tests
**Purpose**: Verify critical endpoints and external services are reachable.

```typescript
// src/__tests__/ApiHealth.test.ts
- ✅ API endpoints are reachable
- ✅ External service connections work
- ✅ Network failures handled gracefully
```

## 🔍 Cross-Cutting Concerns Testing

### 3. Performance Testing
**Purpose**: Ensure application performs well under normal and stress conditions.

```typescript
// src/__tests__/Performance.test.tsx
- ✅ App renders within acceptable time (<1s)
- ✅ Large lists render efficiently (<500ms)
- ✅ No memory leaks in multiple renders
- ✅ Component updates are efficient
- ✅ No excessive DOM nodes created
```

### 4. Security Testing
**Purpose**: Prevent common security vulnerabilities.

```typescript
// src/__tests__/Security.test.tsx
- ✅ Prevents XSS in user input
- ✅ Validates input lengths
- ✅ Sanitizes URLs (blocks javascript: etc.)
- ✅ Prevents CSRF by checking origins
- ✅ Validates environment variables
```

### 5. Accessibility Testing
**Purpose**: Ensure application is usable by people with disabilities.

```typescript
// src/__tests__/Accessibility.test.tsx
- ✅ Supports keyboard navigation
- ✅ Has proper semantic HTML structure
- ✅ Buttons have accessible names
- ✅ Respects reduced motion preferences
- ✅ Has sufficient color contrast
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility
```

### 6. Error Handling & Resilience
**Purpose**: Ensure application gracefully handles errors and edge cases.

```typescript
// src/__tests__/ErrorHandling.test.tsx
- ✅ Error boundary catches component errors
- ✅ Network failures handled gracefully
- ✅ Malformed data handled safely
- ✅ Environment variables validated
```

### 7. Data Validation Testing
**Purpose**: Ensure all data inputs are properly validated.

```typescript
// src/__tests__/DataValidation.test.ts
- ✅ Email validation works correctly
- ✅ Password validation enforced
- ✅ Dangerous input sanitized
- ✅ Edge cases handled (null, undefined, long strings)
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Before Every Commit
- [ ] **Application Health**: No console errors/warnings
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: All components and utilities tested
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: User workflows work end-to-end
- [ ] **API Health**: Critical endpoints are reachable
- [ ] **Performance**: Render times within acceptable limits
- [ ] **Security**: Input validation and XSS prevention
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful failure scenarios
- [ ] **Data Validation**: All inputs properly validated

### Weekly/Release Testing
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Performance under stress
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Dependency vulnerabilities check
- [ ] **Accessibility Audit**: Full axe-core scan
- [ ] **Visual Regression**: UI hasn't broken unexpectedly
- [ ] **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design works correctly
- [ ] **SEO Testing**: Meta tags and structured data correct

## 🛠 Testing Commands

```bash
# Basic testing
npm run test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage     # Generate coverage report

# Specific test categories
npm run test:health       # Application health checks
npm run test:a11y         # Accessibility tests
npm run test:performance  # Performance tests

# Pre-commit validation
npm run pre-commit        # All checks (tests + lint + build)
```

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### Dependencies
```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install -D @testing-library/user-event jest-axe @axe-core/react
```

### Git Hooks (Automated Enforcement)
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./setup-git-hooks.sh

# Windows  
setup-git-hooks.bat
```

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **Tests Must Pass Before Commits** - No exceptions
2. **Test User Behavior, Not Implementation** - Focus on what users experience
3. **Cover Edge Cases** - Test null, undefined, empty, and extreme values
4. **Mock External Dependencies** - Keep tests fast and reliable
5. **Descriptive Test Names** - Tests should read like documentation
6. **Fail Fast** - Tests should catch issues early in development

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ on critical paths
- **Performance**: <1s initial render, <500ms for updates
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Security**: No XSS vulnerabilities, proper input validation
- **Reliability**: No console errors in production builds
